## Introduction

A small arcade game as part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course where you control a lonely character with suicidal tendencies.

## Instructions

To play the game just open index.html in a browser.
You can move the character with the arrow buttons.
On each level you must pick up a star and bring it into the water. After drowning, you get another chance to repeat the same process but this time there is a bug crossing the screen. Don't worry, it's slow. With each star you unleash yet another bug and they become faster too. At the end they will eat you, unless you stay on the grass. But that's boring. You have 3 lives. Gather as many stars as you can. Beat your own record by replaying.


## Dependencies

In order to run the game properly you need these files:
index.html
style.css
engine.js
resources.js
app.js
plus the images folder to see anything :)
